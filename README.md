# Defining Success in this Role

Have you ever been frustrated in a role becuase there was no clear indicators of success?  Have you ever been at a company where success was defined by whatever your boss felt like at any given moment?  

In an effort to avoid that at CureMintÂ®, we have put a significant amount of thought and effort into defining success.  This document details what success looks like for this role.

  

Team Engagement
---------------

Team engagement is critical to success. After all "Team First" is our first value! Being an engaged member of the team is critical to both your personal growth and our overall growth as a company.

  

*   Participates in team discussions
*   Engages in team slack channels
    *   Responds to others when they are engaging the team with either questions or initiating dialog around work they are working on.
    *   Initiates dialog around topics relevant to their job
    *   Shares works in progress with their team early and often. This helps us collaborate cross-functionally
*   Jumps in where needed to assist others
*   Is punctual to and present for team meetings
*   Doesn't do other work during meetings
*   Presents dissenting opinions
*   Recognizes when other teammates are having difficulty and supporting them (team empathy)
*   Is respectful to other team members
*   Recognizes others when they succeed
*   Camera is on most of the time when engaging with team members
*   Asks others "How can I help?"
*   Communicates unavailability to the team

  

Planning & Estimation
---------------------

Our ability to execute well as a company is dependent on our ability to plan and estimate.

  

*   Creates documented build and execution plans (project/product/design/engineering)
*   Identifies and investigates unknowns early
*   Dives into ambiguity as early as possible so we are not caught off guard later
*   Assesses different ways to accomplish the task at hand
*   Asks the question "how else might we accomplish this?"
*   Decomposes large tasks into smaller component parts
*   Accurately estimates works to be done
    *   Estimates are realistic
    *   Estimates are not sandbagged to ensure success
    *   Estimates are dynamic and presented with alternative paths that take into consideration different constraints. (if we take this approach or adjust these constraints then this is the impact on my estimation)
    *   Estimates are not inflated to avoid work you don't want to do
*   Identifies and documents risks as well as contingencies to those risks
*   Identifies area of potential sub-delegation
*   Creates tasks for things that need to be done for progress tracking purposes
*   Identifies how things will be tested as part of the build plan
    *   This could be a combination of manual and automated tests
    *   Identifies automated tests that need to be written (If you think about this during the planning and document it here then you are thinking about things in a TDD way!)

  

Time Management
---------------

As a team, we have lots of demands that pull on us. These demands can absolutely wreck our ability to succeed if not properly managed. It is important for us to lean on systems and good time management skills to ensure these pressures do not sabotage us.

  

*   Is intentional about time. Plans their phase, sprint, week, and day in advance
*   Creates systems and habits that maximize/optimize the effectiveness of their deep work/flow states
*   Stays focused and does not let chasing rabbits sabotage us
    *   Sometimes, chasing rabbits is very important.
    *   This is not saying we shouldn't do it, it says be intentional about it.
    *   Take note of the rabbit, document it, and plan for tackling it later
*   Schedules and plans are well balanced to account for continuous progress on the various aspects of the job.
    *   It would be bad to chunk work that needs to be done every day into one large block at the end of the week.
*   Recognizes procrastination as quickly as possible and snaps self out of it
*   Identifies and discusses with their manager external factors that are getting in the way of successful time management
    *   This could be personal issues

*   Identifies when they are stuck and moves on to another task or responsibility while they await assistance.

  

Progress Tracking
-----------------

Tracking ongoing progress is as important as planning and estimation. If we are diligent about tracking our progress it allows us to make adjustments to the plan on the fly and increase our likelihood of overall success. It also allows others who are depending on us to properly plan. This is absolutely critical to cross-departmental collaboration.

  

*   Is capable of speaking to the progress/status of any tasks/projects they are involved in
*   Reports progress asynchronously on a daily basis
*   Keeps project statuses up to date daily
*   Manages scope creep

*   Communicates a summarized reported problem, diagnosed problem, and solution on all bug tasks they work on
*   Screenshots of front-end works in progress in slack
*   Shows off green passing tests

  

Issue Management

Issues take many forms and when not addressed can be damaging in unexpected and often unquantifiable ways. Recognizing issues is not always easy but it is essential to success.
